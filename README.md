# CellereumRR

This is a remake of my old Telegram Bot called Cellereum.
<br/>This project was abandoned in the beginning of 2021, but it used to be a simple coin and hub for all my upcoming bots.
<br/>The objective was to create a Bot Network called xBot, and Cellereum would be it's hub.
<br/>It's one of my first C# programs, so it's VERY badly written, specially because I was 13 years old when i wrote it.
<br/>The reason i published it on my github is because it has great sentimental value to me and was what started my journey into programming.
<br/>Remember this is the remake version. The original version was WAY worse than this one. Trust me.
